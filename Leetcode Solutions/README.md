# Leetcode Solutions

This repository is the structured output of **Project Sophia**, a powerful, custom-built AI development tool designed to accelerate technical readiness and pattern recognition.  
It proves that the bottleneck in learning is not in writing code, but in generating and verifying **expert-level analysis**.

## What makes these solutions better than typical submissions?

-  **Unprecedented Volume**  
Equivalent of 1–3 years of consistent manual practice — an unmatched speed in acquiring vast algorithmic knowledge, achieved in just 1 month

-  **Guaranteed Optimality**  
  Every solution cross-validated for optimal time & space complexity. No memorized suboptimal code.

-  **Built-in Debugging Intelligence**  
  Verified via proprietary refinement loop using real-world error feedback → robust, deployable code.

-  **Structured Learning**  
  Organized by topic, language, difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard), and tags (hash map, two pointers, etc.) — a queryable expert library.
